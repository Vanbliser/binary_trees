 * binary_tree_insert_left - a function that inserts a node as the left-child

 *
 * Description: If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its
 * place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.
 * Return: a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is
 * NULL
