 * binary_tree_insert_right- a function that inserts a node as the right-child

 * @parent: a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
 * @value: the value to store in the new node
 *
 * Description: If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its
 * place and the old right-child be set as the right-child of the new node.
 * Return: return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if
 * parent is NULL
